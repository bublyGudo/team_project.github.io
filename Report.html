<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Nearly 1.3 million New Yorkers are experiencing food insecurity. Many
of these individuals not only experience lack of food availability, but
lack of access to nutritious and healthy food. Food insecure households
consistently report decreased fruit and vegetable intake, as there are
few options available at their local grocery stores and bodegas for
affordable produce. As such, food insecure individuals were 15.3% more
likely to develop chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease,
hypertension, and obesity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As public health professionals who are passionate about addressing
health disparities, we wanted to explore the relationship between social
determinants, food access, and diet-related health outcomes. The goal of
our project was to examine associations between household income,
walkability, overweight, and food store locations in New York City. We
analyzed these associations for both regular retail food stores and
healthy food stores to identify if there were differences in store
availability and health outcomes between stores with healthier options
and stores without healthy options. Through our project, we aimed to
provide a nuanced picture of food access in New York City.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related work</h2>
<p>This project was inspired by Sony’s APEx (practicum) with <a
href="https://www.cityharvest.org/">City Harvest</a>, a non-profit
organization that provides access to healthy produce for low-income New
Yorkers. Through her work, Sony saw how the populations City Harvest
served were reliant on their bi-weekly mobile markets because they
lacked access to affordable healthy food options. Many simply had few
grocery stores near their homes or had limited access to healthy food at
available stores. Having consistent access to produce within their
neighborhood was crucial for helping these clients manage chronic
diseases and maintain their health. Inspired by Sony’s work, our team
decided to put our public health skills to the task and examine the
intersection between social determinants, accessibility of stores, and
chronic disease outcomes.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial questions</h2>
<p>We began by brainstorming some initial questions to guide data
cleaning and merging:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>How accessible are healthy food stores?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Are they within a walkable distance?</li>
<li>How far are they from subway stations, and how many subway stations
are within a walkable distance?</li>
<li>How concentrated are they in each neighborhood?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>How does the food quality compare for each store in each
neighborhood?</p></li>
<li><p>How about the standard grocery price (such as buying bread, milk,
eggs etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>How does the density of healthy food stores compare to the
overweight and diabetes rate in each borough？</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p>Due to the limitations and the need for coherence with the general
research question, we modified our questions to be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the association between density (number of stores) of
general food stores /pantries and household income in the year
2020?</p></li>
<li><p>Is increased density (nunmber of stores) of healthy stores
associated with lower rates of overweight by borough?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the walking distance from the subway to the
groceries?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The data cleaning process was extensive and can be found <a
href="https://bublygudo.github.io/team_project.github.io/data_cleaning.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The pattern we followed for all data cleaning was merging the
predictor and outcome datasets (eg. Retail_Food_Store_clean.csv with
Percentage Overweight by Borough.csv).</p>

<h3>T-test: Pandemic Impact on Grocery Store Density by Borough</h3>
<p>To evaluate the impact of the pandemic on grocery store numbers, a
t-test was conducted to compare the number of stores before and after
the pandemic, determining whether the observed changes were
statistically significant.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>For our two analyses of the relationship between household income and
food store availability, our outcomes contradicted what we expected to
find. The results for our Spearman’s rank tests for both retail food
stores and healthy food stores indicated that there were significant
negative associations between store density per zip code and household
income. This suggests that zip codes with lower household incomes had
higher densities of retail and healthy food stores. Our leaflet map
confirmed this association, as it displays several areas that are not
high income where there are high densities of retail and healthy food
stores. We believe that one potential explanation for this association
is that programming to increase food access has effectively increased
the number of stores available in low-income communities. However, there
may also be additional confounding factors, such as population density
and access to transportation, that may also have caused this
association.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our initial EDA bar graph of healthy food stores in each borough
found that Brooklyn had the highest number of healthy food stores, and
Staten Island had the lowest number of healthy food stores. Our two
analyses of percent overweight per zip code by number of food stores
have yielded mixed results. The Spearman’s test on percent overweight by
number of retail food stores indicates a significant positive
relationship between percent overweight by zip code and number of retail
food stores. This result is consistent with our knowledge of chronic
disease outcomes and food access, as increased access to general food
stores may increase rates of overweight if these stores contain fewer
healthy options and more calorie dense foods. However, our second
Spearman’s test found that there was not a significant association
between healthy food stores and percent overweight by zip code. This
indicates that rates of overweight does not differ substantially based
on access to healthy food stores. There are potential confounders to be
explored, such as daily physical activity and neighborhood walkability,
which may have influenced this association. However, we can also
consider the possibility that perhaps healthy stores are not as
effective of an intervention as we initially perceived. Future research
can provide more detailed metrics on the quality of food at farmers
markets and healthy food stores, as well as how many people within these
zip codes are actually purchasing produce from these stores.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We conducted a two-sample t-test to see if the pandemic influenced
the number of healthy food stores available. Our reasoning was that
potential store closures during the pandemic may have impacted the
number of healthy food stores and farmers markets that were able to stay
open. However, our test found that there was not a significant
difference in number of healthy food stores pre and post-pandemic. We
conjecture that perhaps many of these stores were able to stay open
through the pandemic, or that additional stores may have opened as
restrictions were relaxed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Through our visualizations of average walking distance and average
walking time from subway stations to stores, we found that Manhattan
appeared to have significantly lower walking distances and walking times
in comparison to Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. We found that there
were no significant overall changes in walking distance between retail
and healthy food stores in each borough, indicating that there are not
significant borough-level disparities. However, when we examined the zip
codes with the five highest and lowest walking distances, we found that
most of the zip codes with the lowest walking distances were
concentrated in Manhattan, and most of the zip codes with the highest
walking distances were concentrated in the Bronx. We believe that this
disparity may be due to higher numbers of subway stations in Manhattan
in comparison to the Bronx. We also found that several of the zip codes
with the highest and lowest walking distances were located in Brooklyn,
which may indicate that there is high disparity in walking distances
among Brooklyn neighborhoods.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on all of our results, it is clear that further analysis is
needed to understand relationships between food access, social
determinants, and chronic health outcomes. Many of our results
contradicted our initial perceptions of these relationships, such as the
negative association between household income and food store
availability and the lack of significance for the association between
percent overweight and availability of healthy stores. As such, we
believe that further efforts are needed to explore other explanations
for why we may have found these results. We suggest that subsequent
research on healthy food access in New York City be directed
towards:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Examining the efficacy of healthy food store interventions in
reducing chronic disease outcomes</p></li>
<li><p>Examining the efficacy of the city’s programming in increasing
availability of healthy stores in low-income zip codes</p></li>
<li><p>Examining disparities between zip codes in accessing food stores
by public transportation</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p>We hope that our project can serve as a foundation for future work to
understand the complexities of how healthy food access impacts the
health and well being of marginalized communities.</p>
