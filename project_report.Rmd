# Data: Source cleaning (Source, cleaning)

*1. map in landing page: The data cleaning process involved standardizing column names using janitor::clean_names() across all datasets, renaming key columns (e.g., year_awarded ‚Üí year, farmers_market ‚Üí store_name, address ‚Üí store_address), and selecting relevant variables (store_name, borough, year, store_address, latitude, longitude). Duplicate entries based on latitude and longitude were removed. Specific corrections included fixing borough names (e.g., "New York" ‚Üí "Manhattan", "Queen" ‚Üí "Queens"), and adding a type column to categorize establishments as "healthy store," "farmer market," or "retail store". The cleaned datasets were combined into a single dataset and saved as stores_markets_retails.csv.*


*2. walkability tool: To prepare the data for mapping healthy stores, farmer markets and retail stores within walking distance (400 meters) of subway stations, rows with missing latitude or longitude were removed from both the Stores and Subway datasets. Both datasets were then converted into simple feature (sf) objects using st_as_sf() with latitude and longitude as coordinates. The coordinate reference system (CRS) was set to EPSG:4326 (WGS84), enabling accurate geospatial analysis and visualization.*

*3. assocaiton beetween number of stores and overweight percentages: To explore the association between healthy stores/farmers markets and overweight percentages, the Healthy Stores and Farmers Market datasets were cleaned by standardizing column names, renaming key variables, removing duplicates, and selecting relevant columns. These datasets were then combined into a unified dataset, stores_farmer_market. Overweight data was similarly cleaned by splitting the Percent column into separate components, converting percentages to numeric, and renaming columns for consistency. The combined dataset was grouped by borough and year to calculate the total number of healthy stores and farmers markets. Finally, these counts were merged with the cleaned overweight data using a full join, enabling borough-level analysis of trends and associations over time.*

# Exploratory analysis: Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.

## Map for landing page

*1. Interactive map on landing page is to provide an intuitive visual representation of the geographic distribution of healthy stores, retail stores, and farmer markets across NYC. The interactive map was created using the leaflet package.*

*2. The map uses CartoDB.Positron tiles background with adjusted transparency (opacity = 0.8) for clarity and aesthetic appeal. Each type of food sources was given a unique color for easy differentiation. Each marker displays detailed information (store name, borough, address, and type) when clicked. Color-coded markers and detailed popups make it easy to identify and explore the locations of different food sources. The use of an interactive map ensures that stakeholders can explore the data in an intuitive, spatial format.*

*3. The map allows users to observe clustering patterns and disparities in access to food-related resources.*


## Bar graphs to show the number of healthy stores/farmer markets in each borough

*1. To compare the number of healthy stores and farmer markets across NYC boroughs. A grouped bar plot was used to summarize and display the total number of food sources in each borough.*

*2. Data was grouped by borough and the counts were summed using sum(count, na.rm = TRUE). X-axis: Boroughs were set as the independent variable. Y-axis: Total counts of healthy stores and farmer markets. Fill Color: Borough-specific colors were used for visual differentiation.*

*3. A bar plot is intuitive for comparing discrete categories (boroughs) and their respective totals.This plot highlights boroughs with the highest and lowest access to healthy stores and farmer markets, emphasizing disparities in resource distribution.*


## Scatterplot to show overweight percentage changes by year in each borough

*1. A scatter plot with loess smoothing lines for each borough was used to display trends. Excluded data for 2023 (filter(year != 2023)) due to incomplete or anomalous data for this year. X-axis: Treated year as a continuous variable (as.numeric(year)) to show trends over time. Displayed all years explicitly using scale_x_continuous() with unique labels for readability. Y-axis: Represented overweight_percentage as the dependent variable. Points and Smoothing Lines: Points: Represent individual borough-year overweight percentages. Smoothing Lines: Added loess (local regression) smoothing to highlight trends for each borough without assuming linearity. Each borough was given a distinct color for differentiation in the visualization.*

*2. Scatter plots with smoothing lines are effective for visualizing trends over time, particularly when the relationships may not be linear.*

#  Additional analysis: If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail

## 1.Linear plot to show association Between the Number of Healthy Stores/Farmer Markets and Overweight Percentages

*It is to examine the relationship between the availability of healthy stores and farmer markets and overweight percentages across NYC boroughs.*

*A scatter plot with loess smoothing was used to explore the association between count (number of healthy stores/farmer markets) and overweight_percentage. X-axis: Represents the number of healthy stores and farmer markets (count), which is the independent variable. Y-axis: Represents the overweight percentage (overweight_percentage), which is the dependent variable. Points represent borough-level data for the number of stores and the corresponding overweight percentage. Smoothing line added loess smoothing to visualize the trend without assuming a specific functional form of the relationship.*


*Scatter plots are well-suited for exploring relationships between two continuous variables. The addition of loess smoothing helps reveal patterns or trends in the data without imposing a linear relationship.*

## linear regression is to evaluate the association between the number of healthy stores/farmer markets (count) and overweight percentages (overweight_percentage) using a simple linear regression model.

*The linear model was specified as: overweight_percentage =ùõΩ0 +ùõΩ1√ócount +ùúñ. Dependent Variable: overweight_percentage. Independent Variable: count.*

*The summary(model) output was tidied using the broom::tidy() function for a clean tabular format. The table was formatted using knitr::kable() for presentation.*

*The tidy table of model coefficients provides estimate that is the estimated effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. The coefficient for count indicates how much overweight_percentage changes for each additional healthy store/farmer market. p-value is to assess a statistically significant association.*

*Simple and interpretable, making it suitable for evaluating the relationship between two variables.*

## residual plot
*1. The Residuals vs. Fitted Values plot is used to evaluate the assumptions of a linear.Linearity: The relationship between predictors and the dependent variable should be linear. Homoscedasticity: The residuals should have constant variance across fitted values.Independence: Residuals should not show patterns or correlations.No Outliers: Extreme values should not unduly influence the model.*

*2.X-axis: The fitted values (fitted_values) represent the predicted overweight percentages based on the regression model.Y-axis: The residuals (residuals) are the differences between the observed overweight percentages and the fitted values. A horizontal line at y = 0 (red, dashed) represents the ideal scenario where residuals are randomly scattered around zero.*

*3. Interpretation of the Plot: If the residuals are randomly scattered around the horizontal line (y = 0), it suggests that the linearity assumption is met.*


# Discussion: (findings? expect? insights? limitations?)

## 1. Distribution of Healthy Stores/Farmer Markets Across Boroughs

*1. Brooklyn has the highest number of healthy stores and farmer markets, followed by the Bronx and Manhattan.Queens and Staten Island have significantly fewer healthy stores and farmer markets.*

*2. The result is what we expected. Larger boroughs with higher population densities like Brooklyn and the Bronx are expected to have more establishments. Staten Island‚Äôs lower density explains its fewer establishments.*

*3. Disparity in the availability of healthy food resources is evident. Policy efforts should target underserved boroughs (e.g., Staten Island and Queens) to improve access to healthy food options.*

## 2. Overweight Percentage Changes by Year in Each Borough

*1. The Bronx and Staten Island have the highest overweight percentages, peaking around 70%. Manhattan consistently shows the lowest overweight percentages. Overweight percentages have generally declined since 2017‚Äì2018.*

*2. The result is what we expected. Disparities align with socioeconomic and geographic differences. Affluent areas like Manhattan are more likely to support healthier lifestyles, while areas like the Bronx face systemic challenges.*

*3.Declining overweight percentages may reflect the impact of health initiatives. Borough-specific interventions are necessary to address persistently high rates in the Bronx and Staten Island.*

## 3. Association Between Number of Healthy Stores/Farmer Markets and Overweight Percentages

1. Scatter plot with LOESS smoothing shows a weak, linear relationship between the variables.
Regression analysis indicates a small negative but statistically insignificant association (estimate = -0.0499, p-value = 0.475).

2. Partially, it is what we expected. While access to healthy stores is hypothesized to reduce overweight percentages, the weak association suggests other factors play a larger role.
3. Obesity-related issues are complex and influenced by multiple factors beyond access to healthy stores, such as socioeconomic status, education, and access to exercise facilities. Increasing the number of healthy stores alone may not suffice; broader interventions are needed.

## 4. Residuals vs. Fitted Values Plot
1. Residuals are randomly scattered around the horizontal line (y = 0), with no clear patterns or clustering. Residual spread remains fairly constant, indicating homoscedasticity.

2. It is what we expected: the plot supports assumptions of linear regression.

3. The model is valid for the data despite the weak association between variables, limiting its predictive power.

## 5. The map of food sources (landing page)

*1.The interactive map displays the geographic distribution of food-related establishments in New York City. Blue markers (Healthy Stores), green markers (Retail Stores) and red markers (Farmer Markets) reveal noticeable clusters and disparities in availability across boroughs. There is a higher density of markers in areas such as Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, while Staten Island and Queens exhibit lower densities.*

*2. The clustering of resources in Manhattan and Brooklyn aligns with expectations due to their higher population density and more developed infrastructure. Lower marker density in Staten Island is consistent with its smaller population and suburban characteristics. Disparities in the distribution of resources, especially in boroughs like Queens and Staten Island, reflect known patterns of inequitable access to healthy food resources.*


*3. Areas with higher marker density represent better access to healthy food resources, whereas sparsely marked regions indicate underserved areas. The data reinforces the need for targeted interventions to improve access in resource-scarce neighborhoods, particularly in parts of Queens and Staten Island. The map provides stakeholders with a visual understanding of where to focus efforts for improving food equity across NYC.*

## 6. Walkability to Food Sources from Subway Stations

*1. The map illustrates food source accessibility within a 400-meter walking radius of subway stations along the Astoria line. Food sources (green markers) are generally clustered around subway stations, suggesting that many establishments are accessible to public transit users. Some stations have sparse or no food sources within their walking radius, highlighting potential gaps in accessibility.*

*It is expected that areas around subway stations would have a higher density of food sources due to increased foot traffic and urban planning focused on convenience. However, the absence of food sources near some stations, despite their connectivity, was less expected and may point to localized factors such as zoning regulations or lower population density.*

*3. Well-Served Areas: Stations with dense clusters of food sources offer a variety of options to residents and commuters. Underserved Areas: Gaps in accessibility around certain stations could highlight neighborhoods where improving access to food sources is critical.Policy Implications: Data can inform urban planning efforts, such as encouraging healthy food establishments near underserved stations.*

# Limitations
*1.Complex Influences: Obesity is multifactorial; future analyses should include variables like income, education, and physical activity access.*

*2.Data Gaps: Missing or incomplete data (e.g., 2023) limits temporal analysis.*

*3.Linear Models: Consider advanced modeling to capture complex relationships.*
