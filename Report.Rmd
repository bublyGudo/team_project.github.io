### Initial questions

We began by brainstorming some initial questions to guide data cleaning and merging:

1. How accessible are healthy food stores?

    a. Are they within a walkable distance?
    b. How far are they from subway stations, and how many subway stations are within a walkable distance?
    c. How concentrated are they in each neighborhood?
    

2. How does the food quality compare for each store in each neighborhood? 

3. How about the standard grocery price (such as buying bread, milk, eggs etc.) 

4. How does the density of healthy food stores compare to the overweight and diabetes rate in each  boroughï¼Ÿ 

<br><br>

Due to the limitations and the need for coherence with the general research question, we modified our questions to be:

1. What is the association between density (number of stores) of general food stores /pantries and household income in the year 2020?

2. Is increased density (nunmber of stores) of healthy stores associated with lower rates of overweight by borough? 
3. What is the walking distance from the subway to the groceries?
