<h3>Project Introduction</h3>
<p>Our team is diving into the world of Food Access and Food Justice in
New York City, armed with data on healthy food stores, farmers’ markets,
retail shops, and food pantries. We’re on a mission to uncover how the
number of these spots connects to things like housing income, how many
people are struggling with being overweight, and how easy it is to walk
to these places. By piecing together these clues, we’re aiming to
spotlight patterns and unfair gaps in food access, all while dreaming of
a city where everyone can find healthy food just around the corner.</p>
<p>On this page you can find a neat interactive map where you can spot
sources of food in the NYC area!</p>
<p>We found that there are clusters of healthy food stores (e.g.,
farmers markets, fresh food boxes, healthy shops) in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn and Morris Heights, Bronx.</p>
<p><br></p>
