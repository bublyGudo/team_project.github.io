The completion of this project required a great deal of data cleaning given the many datasets that were utilized (see Data Sources page). Below, we briefly summarize the steps we took to clean, merge, tidy, and generally prepare our datasets for exploratory and additional analyses. You can find the data cleaning process for every tab on our website here.

### 1. Welcome to Food Sources (Home Page Map)

1.1 Healthy Stores Dataset:
Standardized column names using janitor::clean_names().
Corrected borough name from "New York" to "Manhattan".
Renamed columns:
year_awarded → year
street_address → store_address.
Selected relevant columns: store_name, borough, year, store_address, latitude, longitude.
Removed duplicate entries based on latitude and longitude.
Added a new column type with the value "healthy store".

1.2 Farmers Market Dataset:
Standardized column names using janitor::clean_names().
Renamed columns:
farmers_market → store_name
address → store_address.
Selected relevant columns: store_name, borough, year, store_address, latitude, longitude.
Removed duplicate entries based on latitude and longitude.
Added a type column with the value "farmer market".
Corrected longitude values for two markets:
Saratoga Farm Stand (corrected from dataset).
Morris Heights Farmstand (corrected using online data).

1.3 Retail Food Stores Dataset:
Standardized column names using janitor::clean_names().
Created a new address column by combining street_number and street_name.
Renamed columns:
entity_name → store_name
address → store_address.
Added columns:
year with the value 2014.
type with the value "retail store".
Selected relevant columns: store_name, borough, year, store_address, latitude, longitude, type.
Removed duplicate entries based on latitude and longitude.

1.4 Combining All Datasets:
Combined the cleaned datasets (stores, farmer_market, retail_stores, and pantries) using rbind().
Corrected borough name: "Queen" → "Queens".
Saved the combined dataset as stores_markets_retails_pantries.csv.


### 2. ShinyApp: Walkability

2.1 Load the Dataset: The read.csv() function is used to load the dataset from the file MTA_Subway_Stations_20241106.csv.

2.2 Standardize Column Names: The janitor::clean_names() function ensures that column names are standardized to lowercase and snake_case for consistency and ease of use in further analysis.

2.3 Select Relevant Columns: The select() function keeps only the necessary columns: line, stop_name, gtfs_latitude, gtfs_longitude, and borough.
Irrelevant columns are removed, reducing noise in the dataset.

2.4 Clean the borough Values: The mutate() function is used to clean and standardize the borough values:
"Q" is replaced with "Queens".
"M" is replaced with "Manhattan".
"Bk" is replaced with "Brooklyn".
"Bx" is replaced with "Bronx".
"SI" is replaced with "Staten Island".

2.5 Rename Columns: The rename() function renames gtfs_latitude and gtfs_longitude to latitude and longitude, respectively, for clarity and consistency.

2.6 Save the Cleaned Dataset: The cleaned dataset is written to a new file subway.csv using the write.csv() function, allowing for easy reuse in subsequent analyses.

2.7 Filter Out Missing Coordinates:
Stores Dataset: Removed rows with missing latitude or longitude.
Subway Dataset: Removed rows with missing latitude or longitude.

2.8 Convert to sf Objects:
Converted both datasets to simple feature (sf) objects using st_as_sf():
Stores Dataset: Used latitude and longitude for coordinates.
Subway Dataset: Used latitude and longitude for coordinates.
Set the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) to EPSG:4326 (WGS84).

### 3. Store Density vs Overweight Percentage

3.1 Healthy Stores Dataset:
Standardized column names using janitor::clean_names().
Corrected the borough name from "New York" to "Manhattan".
Renamed:
year_awarded → year
store_name → healthy_store_market.
Removed duplicate entries based on latitude and longitude.
Selected relevant columns: healthy_store_market, borough, year.

3.2 Farmers Market Dataset:
Standardized column names using janitor::clean_names().
Removed duplicate entries based on latitude and longitude.
Selected relevant columns: farmers_market, borough, year.
Renamed:
farmers_market → healthy_store_market.

3.3 Combining Healthy Stores and Farmers Markets:
Combined the cleaned healthy stores and farmers market datasets using rbind() into a unified dataset stores_farmer_market.

3.4 Overweight Data:
Standardized column names using janitor::clean_names().
Split the Percent column into three new columns (percent, low_confidence, high_confidence) using separate().
Converted percent to numeric for accurate calculations.
Renamed:
geography → borough
time_period → year
percent → overweight_percentage.
Selected relevant columns: overweight_percentage, borough, year.

3.5 Counting Stores and Markets by Borough and Year:
Grouped the stores_farmer_market dataset by year and borough.
Calculated the count of healthy stores and farmers' markets for each borough and year.

3.6 Joining Healthy Stores/Markets with Overweight Data:
Merged the store/market counts with the overweight dataset (overweight) using a full join on year and borough.
Converted the year column to a factor for categorical analysis.

### 4. Healthy Food Store Density vs Median Household Income in 2020

4.1 Expand on stores_farmer_market
Filtered stores_farmer_market.csv for 2020 and identified missing latitude/longitude values.
Used tinygeocoder to fill missing coordinates and merged them back into the dataset.
Converted data to spatial points and performed a spatial join with NY ZIP code shapefiles.
Exported cleaned data with ZIP codes to healthy_stores_with_zips.csv.

4.2 Household Income Data for 2020
Cleaned Household Income_NYC_by zip_2020.csv:
* Standardized column names.
* Selected and renamed relevant columns.
* Removed non-numeric characters and converted income values to numeric.
Exported cleaned income data to hh_income_2020.csv.

4.3 Merge Healthy Store and Household Income Datasets
Merged healthy stores and income data by ZIP code.
Excluded Staten Island due to differences in transportation assumptions.
Exported final dataset to healthy_stores_hh_data.csv.

### 5. Comparing Healthy Food Stores Pre- and Post-Pandemic

5.1 Filter and Aggregate Data
Filtered stores_farmer_market.csv for 2019 and 2023.
Counted the number of healthy food stores per borough and year.

5.2 Prepare Data for T-Test
Pivoted data to compare store counts in 2019 and 2023 by borough.
Dropped rows with missing values and created a summary table.
