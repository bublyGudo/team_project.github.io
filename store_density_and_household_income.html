<p>Merge healthy stores dataset with zip codes and household income data
for 2020. I removed any observations from “Staten Island” as they are
few. Additionally, I suspect that the number of stores within a zip code
may not be indicative of access to healthy food stores, since a main
mode of transportation in State Island is by car. Our analyses about NYC
are based on an assumption that most people are accessing their healthy
foods via some form of public transportation.</p>

<p>We added income brackets to the <code>healthy_stores_hh_data</code>

<p>We see a non-signification p-value of 0.09.</p>
<p>However, is it appropriate to use a linear model in this case? Let’s
check assumptions of linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity for
median income and number of stores.</p>
<p>These tests will validate whether linear regression is appropriate
for this relationship. Using <code>autoplot</code>, we can quickly
visualize residuals (linearity and homoscedasticity check), and a Q-Q
plot and histogram (normality check).</p>

<p>In the residuals vs. fitted plot, we can observe clustering on the
upper end of the fitted values. Additionally, there is somewhat of a
funnel shape with fewer fitted values on the lower end and many fitted
values on the upper end. Furthermore, there are three distinct outliers
on the upper end with large residuals. These findings hint at a lack of
linearity and heteroscedasticity.</p>
<p>In the Q-Q plot, we can observe that most residual points fall along
the dotted line. However, several of the upper residual points fall very
far from the line, hinting somewhat at a curve.</p>
<p>Plot histogram of the residuals</p>

The histogram of the residuals corroborates much of what we had already
seen. The distribution of the residuals is right skewed, likely due to
the outliers we observed. We may venture to hypothesize that those
outliers are related to the three clusters we saw in the chloropleth for
zip codes in Harlem, the Bronx, and Manhattan.</p>
<p>Finally, we can look at the scatterplot of the linear model for
further visual inspection.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(stores_by_zip_unique, aes(x = median_income, y = num_stores)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE, color = &quot;blue&quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(

    x = &quot;Median Income&quot;,
    y = &quot;Number of Stores&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using formula =
## &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="store_density_and_household_income_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="672" />
There are several outliers on the lower end of median household incomes
where we observe high number of stores. Furthermore, we can see that we
have many more observations for incomes below $150,000.00 than above.
This difference in number of observations at different median income
levels could be contributing to the a difference in variance across the
distribution. Overall, we can conclude that a linear regression model is
not appropriate for this dataset due to several limitations including a
small sample size, few observations available for certain income
brackets, and the outliers observed at the lower end of the income
spectrum.</p>
<p>To identify our extreme observations (outliers), we have summarized
the top and bottom 5 zip codes by number of food stores.</p>

<p>We can see here that in the Brooklyn zip code 11206, there are 45
healthy food stores. This zip code falls within the Williamsburg
neighborhood. It is following by the Bronx zip code 10453 with 35
healthy food stores. This zip code falls within the Morris Heights
neighborhood. These two observations align with the clusters we saw
earlier in the map, as those clusters correspond to these two zip
codes.</p>
<p>The disproportionately high number of healthy food stores in
Williamsburg (11206) and Morris Heights (10453) may be influenced by
several factors. These neighborhoods could be beneficiaries of targeted
public health initiatives or grants aimed at improving food access, such
as farmers’ markets or NYC-specific programs. Gentrification in
Williamsburg has likely shifted demographics, attracting wealthier
residents who demand more health-conscious options, while community
advocacy efforts in both areas may have supported the establishment of
healthy food markets and urban agriculture projects.</p>

<h3>Additional Analysis</h3>
<p>Given the assumptions violations for linear regression, we decided to
instead utilize a Spearman Ranked correlation to capture the non-linear
relationship between number of stores and median household income.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spearman_result = 
  stores_by_zip_unique %&gt;%
  summarise(
    spearman_rho = cor(num_stores, median_income, method = &quot;spearman&quot;),
    p_value = cor.test(num_stores, median_income, method = &quot;spearman&quot;)$p.value
  )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: There was 1 warning in
## `summarise()`.
## ℹ In argument: `p_value =

  ) %&gt;%
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c(&quot;Spearman Correlation (ρ)&quot;, &quot;P-value&quot;),
    caption = &quot;Spearman Correlation Between Number of Stores and Median Income&quot;

<p>Interpretation: While the negative relationship is statistically
significant (p-value = 0.006), the weak magnitude of the correlation (ρ
= -0.293) suggests that <code>median_income</code> alone is not a strong
predictor of the number of healthy food stores. Other factors, such as
population density, zoning, or transportation, may play more substantial
roles.</p>
