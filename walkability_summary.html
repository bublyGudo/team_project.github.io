<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Walkability of Stores from Subway
Stations</h1>

</div>


<p>Here, we will look at walking distance and walking time from subway
stations to both healthy food stores and retail food stores. For the
purposes of our analysis, we have omitted Staten Island, as there are
few subway stations available in this borough.</p>

<div id="distances-by-borough" class="section level2">
<h2>Distances by Borough</h2>
<p>First, let us take a look at distances from subway stations to all
food stores in each zip code, and see if there are any differences by
borough.</p>

<p>Here is a graph that allows you to visualize the average distance
from every type of food store to subway station for each borough. If you
hover over the points, you can see the zip code of each observation and
the average distance in meters. Generally acceptable walking distances
to grocery stores is around 400 meters to 800 meters.</p>
<p>From this graph, it appears that Manhattan has lower walking
distances for most zip codes than Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. There
are several high outlier values in Brooklyn and Queens: “11420”,
“11691”, and “11236”.</p>

<p>Here is a boxplot to look at the distribution of the average
distances by zipcode for each of the boroughs. If you move your cursor
over the boxes, you can see the medians, upper and lower quantiles,
upper and lower fence, and minimum and maximum values. Manhattan has
both a lower median distance (556 meters) and lower and smaller
distribution than the other boroughs. Brooklyn has the highest median
distance (935 meters), and the largest difference between highest and
lowest values. This is due to the outliers that are present at both the
higher and lower ends of the box plot.</p>

<h2>Walking Time to Subways</h2>
<p>Now, lets take a look at how long it would take to walk from subways
to food stores. The average person walks at a speed of 1.4 meters per
second. Based on this, let us see the average number of minutes it takes
to travel from subways to food stores by borough.</p>

<p>This bar graph shows that Manhattan has a much lower average walking
time (6 mins) in comparison to Queens (11 mins), the Bronx (12 mins),
and Brooklyn (12 mins). This suggests that Manhattan zip codes may, on
average, have stations closer to food stores in comparison to the other
boroughs.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see if there are differences in walking distance to
general “retail” food stores and specifically healthy food stores.</p>

<p>It appears that differences in walking time from subways is similar
between healthy and retail food stores in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and
Manhattan. In Queens, the walking time is slightly lower for healthy
stores (9 minutes) in comparison to retail stores (11 minutes). It
appears that accesibility of healthy stores by subway is not much
different than for retail food stores at the borough level.</p>
<p>But are there specific zip codes within certain boroughs that have
disproportionately higher or lower walking distances for retail food
stores or healthy food stores? Let us visualize which zip codes and
boroughs have the 5 highest and lowest walking distances for both retail
food stores and healthy food stores.</p>

<p>Based on these tables, we can see that zip codes with the highest
walking distance to healthy and retail food stores are concentrated in
Brooklyn and the Bronx. The zip codes with the lowest walking distance
are concentrated in Manhattan and Brooklyn. It appears that Manhattan
has most of the zip codes with the lowest walking distances from all
food stores to subways, and the Bronx has most of the zip codes with the
highest walking distances from all food stores to subways. This may be
because Manhattan has more than twice as many subway stations as the
Bronx, and therefore it is easier to access public transport that is
located near food stores.</p>
<p>For healthy food stores, it appears that Brooklyn has several zip
codes for both the highest and lowest walking distances. This indicates
that there may be disparities among Brooklyn zip codes in accessing
healthy food stores. Some zip codes may have greater access to subway
stations nearby healthy food stores in comparison to other neighborhoods
in Brooklyn. As we saw in both the scatter plot and the box plot above,
there seem to be several zip codes that are either disproportionately
high or disproportionately low for travel distances. It appears that
there are major differences in accesibility of food stores by subway for
several specific zip codes in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Perhaps additional analyses must be done to explore the relationship
between accessibility of public transport and food access in New
York!</p>
